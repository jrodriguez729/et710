<h1>Apple Review of New Announcement</h1>

<p>




The recent Apple announcement provided information in regards to the new software that will be released sometime this year. The announcement included information on the new iPhone 7, Air Pod Wireless Earbuds, and the Series 2 Apple Watch. What I think of this announcement and soon to be released software, is that not only did they exceed many of my and or other people’s expectations, but they continue to further develop and their software just as they’ve done so over the years.
The Air Pod Earbuds will surely come in handy, as oppose to regular Apple Earbuds, due to the fact that they are wireless. The new iPhone 7 is faster, easier, and more secure to scan your fingerprint. It is also water resistant, which is always a plus.
